=== ip-router.click ===

A pure IPv4 Router.

=== ip-router-nat.click ===

It is important that the interface, used in the config, didn't have an IP
address. If there have one, the Kernel network stack will kept track of the
connections and will reset them if he can't map the used IP addresses in the
packet.

=== ipc-test.click ===
